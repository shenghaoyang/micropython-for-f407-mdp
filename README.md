This repository only serves to host binary files, pending the PR for the
main MicroPython repository [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/8261).

See the releases page.

Flashing the binary

FlyMCU can be used as normal.

Useful tools
------------

- [`pyboard`](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/pyboard.py.html)

    - Using it as a library for scripted interactions seems extremely useful.

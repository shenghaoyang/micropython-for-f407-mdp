See the releases page.

Flashing the binary

The REPL is available on the middle USB port at 115200 baud. Use any serial
terminal (Tera Term, etc).

Useful tools

- [`pyboard`](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/pyboard.py.html)

    - Using it as a library for scripted interactions seems extremely useful.
